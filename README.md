I developed an advanced AI board game that incorporates several sophisticated algorithms to achieve expert-level gameplay and tactical mastery. The algorithms used include:

Minimax: A decision-making algorithm used in game theory to minimize the potential loss for a worst-case scenario.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree.

Swarm Intelligence: Inspired by the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, such as swarm behavior in nature.

Heuristic Search: A search algorithm that uses heuristics to find an optimal solution more efficiently.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): A probabilistic search algorithm used for decision-making processes in games, especially games with large search spaces.

Genetic Algorithm: A search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics, used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems.

Fuzzy Logic: A mathematical approach to handling uncertainty in decision-making, allowing for more nuanced and human-like reasoning.

Each algorithm was implemented and integrated into the board game to evaluate and compare their performance. The goal was to determine which algorithm or combination of algorithms provides the best strategic decision-making and gameplay experience. Through rigorous testing and analysis, insights were gained into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in the context of the game's rules and objectives.

This project not only aimed to create a challenging AI opponent for the board game but also contributed to understanding the applicability and effectiveness of various AI techniques in complex decision-making scenarios.
